![myimage-alt-tag](https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/25618235/thumb/8.jpg)

##  PROBLEM STATEMENT
 To build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables.
 
 ## Dataset Description

We have taken our datasets from UCI Machine learning Repository. 
Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal.
White wine consists of 4898 samples and red wine contains 1599 samples. Each sample of both types of wine consists of 12 physicochemical variables:
1. Fixed acidity 
2. Volatile acidity
3. Citric acid 
4. Residual sugar 
5. Chlorides 
6. Free sulfur dioxide 
7. Total sulfur dioxide
8. Density 
9. pH 
10. Sulphates 
11. Alcohol 
12. Quality

## Technology Used
1. Python programming Language
2. Advanced Python libraries:

       a. Pandas      
       b. matplotlib      
       c. numpy      
       d. scikit-learn
      
3. Machine Learning Algorithm - Decision Tree

## Methodology

We have followed a step by step procedure for the analysis of our dataset. We have undertaken the following steps while performing data analysis:

1. Data Pre-Processing
2. Data Visualization
3. Applying Machine Learning Algorithm

## Results 

Accuracy from Decision Tree Classifier is 86.4%
